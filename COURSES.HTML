             <p>
                    Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) is an academic program offered at our university that integrates the fields of computer engineering and computer science, providing knowledge of computing systems in both hardware and software design.
                    Courses include computer architecture, processor design, operating systems, computer networks, parallel processing, embedded systems, circuit analysis, analog and digital electronics, computer graphics, cloud, web and mobile computing, software engineering,
                    database systems, digital signal processing, virtualization, computer simulations and games programming. CSE programs also include core subjects of theoretical computer science such as theory of computation, design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, numerical analysis, machine learning, information theory, programming
                    language theory and paradigms. The program aims at designing, developing and troubleshooting computing devices and systems (such as personal computers, supercomputers, robots, smartphones, networking devices, embedded devices), focusing the underlying fundamental issues (like processor architecture design, operating system design, memory management, digital system design, 
                    communication protocol design, system software development, application software development, database management, high-performance and scientific computing) in the most efficient and effective way. Emerging computing technologies like image processing, artificial intelligence, deep learning and data science are also covered under these programs. Most of the above CSE areas require initial mathematical
                    knowledge, hence the first year of study is dominated by mathematical courses, primarily discrete mathematics, mathematical analysis, linear algebra, probability theory and statistics, as well as the basics of physics - field theory and electromagnetism.    
             </p>

             <p>
                    The future of Computing rests here. The department's mission is to advance, evolve and enhance Computer Science and Engineering fundamentals to build the intellectual capital of the society. The CSE Department Endeavour’s to be an important regional, national, and international resource center for the development of Computing and its applications. The department is witnessing a period of exciting growth and 
                    opportunity propelled by the growth of technology and its recognition through excellence. CSE boasts a vibrant student body of about 4200 undergraduate and 50 postgraduate students and a stellar faculty of professors and lecturers.

                    <p>
                         Engineering is a continuously evolving subject. As technology has advanced, so have the challenges facing the modern engineer. A silicon chip containing over 200 million transistors in an area no larger than a postage stamp is yesterday's news.
                         EE is a subject that naturally partners with other disciplines to open whole new engineering avenues. Examples include Mechatronics - with Mechanical Engineering, Bio-medical Sciences-with Medicine and Avionics-with Aeronautics. 
                        The EE Department at  SRM University prepares students in this field using new-age information and computer-intensive technologies.

                            "Electrical engineers design, develop, test and supervise the manufacturing of electrical equipment, such as electric motors, radar and navigation systems, communications systems and power generation equipment, states the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Electronics engineers design and develop electronic equipment, such as broadcast and communications systems — from portable music players to global positioning systems (GPS)."
                            If it's a practical, real-world device that produces, conducts or uses electricity, in all likelihood, it was designed by an electrical engineer. Additionally, engineers may conduct or write the specifications for destructive or nondestructive testing of the performance, reliability and long-term durability of devices and components. 
                            Today’s electrical engineers design electrical devices and systems using basic components such as conductors, coils, magnets, batteries, switches, resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes and transistors. Nearly all electrical and electronic devices, from the generators at an electric power plant to the microprocessors in your phone, use these few basic components.

                    <p>
                            Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewerage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.
                            Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering, and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering.
                            Civil engineering takes place in the public sector from municipal through to national governments, and in the private sector from individual homeowners through to international companies.
